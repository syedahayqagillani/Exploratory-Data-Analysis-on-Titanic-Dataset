# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic Dataset**.  
The dataset provides passenger details such as age, gender, class, and survival status.  
The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and extract insights about survival patterns.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
- **Columns include**:  
  - PassengerId  
  - Pclass (Passenger Class)  
  - Name, Sex, Age  
  - SibSp, Parch  
  - Ticket, Fare  
  - Cabin, Embarked  
  - Survived (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)  

---

## 🔑 Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Standardized column formatting  

2. **Categorical Handling**
   - Label Encoding for Sex, Embarked  
   - Mapping categorical values into numerical for analysis  

3. **EDA & Visualization**
   - Distribution of Age, Fare, and Class  
   - Survival rate by gender, class, and family size  
   - Correlation heatmap  

4. **Insight Generation**
   - Female passengers had higher survival rate  
   - First-class passengers survived more than lower classes  
   - Younger children had better survival chances  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Survival rate was strongly influenced by **gender and class**  
- Majority of missing **Cabin data** suggests passengers in lower class had less cabin info  
- Higher fares were linked with better survival odds  

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- Bar charts of survival by **gender** and **class**  
- Age distribution histograms  
- Heatmap of feature correlations
